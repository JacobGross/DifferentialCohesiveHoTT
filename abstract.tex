The internal language of a type theory allows mathematicians to reason
\emph{synthetically} about mathematical structures. While Homotopy Type Theory
provides an internal language for $(∞,1)$-toposes, it is also possible to
consider type theories that correspond to other structures. In previous work,
\citet{Shulman2015} and \citet{Licata2016} construct a type theory for
$(∞,1)$-toposes with an additional ``cohesive'' structure mirroring cohesion of
topological spaces. In this setting, derivations in the type theory correspond
to continuous maps that respect the cohesive structure of the space, which
allows for a synthetic proof of, for example, Brower's fixed-point theorem,
which states that all continuous maps over the topological disk have a fixed
point~\citep{Shulman2015}. This theorem has no synthetic proof in ordinary
homotopy type theory.

To capture cohesion in the type theory, \citep{Shulman2015} and
\citep{Licata2016} use \emph{modal} type theories~\tocite{pfenning and davis?}
to describe the categorical structure of cohesive $(∞,1)$-toposes, which is
shown in black in \cref{fig:modalities}. \todo{say more about the type theory,
  difference between the two papers.}

In this work we extend Shulman's real-cohesive type theory to reason not just
about the cohesive structure of topological spaces, but also the differential
structure. This additional structure, explored by \citet{Schreiber2013}, is
called \emph{differential cohesion}, and is useful for applications in physics
and Cartan geometry~\citep{Wellen2017}. In particular, \citeauthor{Wellen2017}
considers a small fragment of differential cohesive type theory that uses just
the $\Cored$ modality. A full type theory for differential cohesion would cover
not just the three differential modalities, but also the three real-cohesive
modalities, all shown together in \cref{fig:modalities}.

Following the \citeyear{Licata2016} paper on real cohesion, \citet{Licata2017}
develop a general construction for non-dependent modal type theories, which we
instantiate for differential cohesion in this paper. Future work will extend
this type theory to dependent and identity types.
