\JP{How to use comments: use your initials as a command to make a comment
  terminated by your name, \eg \texttt{\textbackslash JP\{my comments\}}. May
  also use \texttt{fixme}, \texttt{note}, \texttt{todo}, and \texttt{tocite}.
  You can change your keyword, color, etc in the preamble. To remove all

Internal languages \FW{I do not know, if Type Theories themselves have internal
  language, as I understand the notion ``internal language'', some Type Theories
  \emph{are} internal languages \emph{of} special categories. So I changed this
  sentence... Great comment-function ;-)} allow mathematicians to reason
\emph{synthetically} about mathematical structures. While Homotopy Type Theory
provides an internal language for $(\infty,1)$-toposes, it is also possible to
consider type theories that correspond to $(\infty,1)$-toposes with extra
structure of interest in algebraic and differential geometry.

\paragraph{Cohesion in adjoint type theory.}

In previous work, \citet{Shulman2015} constructs a type theory for
$(\infty,1)$-toposes with an additional ``cohesive'' structure. In this setting,
derivations in the type theory correspond to continuous maps that respect the
cohesive structure of the space, which provides a framework for a wide variety
of synthetic proofs. For example, Brower's fixed-point theorem, which states
that all continuous maps over the topological disk have a fixed point has no
synthetic proof in ordinary homotopy type theory, but has a proof in cohesive
HoTT~\citep{Shulman2015}.

To capture cohesion in the type theory, \citet{Shulman2015} usees a \emph{modal}
type theory~\citep{Pfenning2001} to describe the categorical structure of
cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes. This structure consists of three
\emph{modalities} \tocite{modalities} that form an adjoint triple
$\shape \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp$; they are described in
\cref{fig:modalities}. In addition, variables in the type theory are marked as
either \emph{cohesive} or \emph{crisp} depending on how they are used in a
term---a typing judgment $\Gamma \mid \Delta \vdash e : \tau$ is continuous on
the cohesive variables in $\Delta$, but may be discontinuous on the crisp
variables in $\Gamma$. The modalities $\flat$ and $\sharp$ are defined as type
and term formation and introduction rules, while $\shape$ is defined as a higher
inductive type.


\paragraph{Differential cohesion in adjoint type theory.}

In this work we aim to construct a type theory similar to Shulman's cohesive
type theory that captures the additional structure of what are called
differential cohesive toposes. \FW{I am quite sure, that Mike invented the term
  ``real cohesion'' for his more specific version of cohesion, where $\shape$ is
  defined as localization using the Dedekind-reals. So I removed ``real'' on
  some instances.} This additional structure, explored and used in
\citet{Schreiber2013} to reason about spaces of interest to modern physics, and
allows synthetic reasoning about higher differential geometry. For example,
\citeauthor{Wellen2017} considers a small fragment of differential cohesive type
theory that uses just the $\Cored$ modality. A full type theory for differential
cohesion would cover not just the three differential modalities, but also the
three cohesive modalities, all shown together in \cref{fig:modalities}.

Following the \citeyear{Licata2016} paper on cohesion, \citet{Licata2017}
developed a general construction for non-dependent modal type theories, which we
instantiate for differential cohesion in this paper. This takes place in two
stages. 

First, in the absence of dependent types, we cannot utilize Shulman's definition
of $\shape$ as a higher inductive type. Instead we give introduction and
elimination rules for $\shape$ internally to the type theory, guided by
\citeauthor{Licata2017}'s general construction. The result is a typing judgment
with three modes, written $\Gamma \mid \Delta \mid \Xi \vdash e : \tau$, where
$\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ still hold crisp and cohesive variables, respectively, and
where $\Xi$ contains \emph{shapely} variables, which are continuous only on the
connected components of the topological structure. In particular, crisp
variables correspond directly to the modality $\flat$, while shapely variables
correspond to the modality $\shape$.

Next, we extend the judgment to differentially cohesive variables. The judgment
$\Gamma \mid \Delta \mid \Theta \mid \Lambda \mid \Xi \vdash e : \tau$ uses
variables in the following way:
\begin{center} \begin{tabular}{lll}
    $\Gamma$ & crisp  &  $\flat$ \\
    $\Delta$ & reduced & $\Red$ \\
    $\Theta$ & differentially cohesive & \\
    $\Lambda$ & coreduced & $\Cored$ \\
    $\Xi$ & shapely & $\shape$
\end{tabular} \end{center}
%
We add the modalities $\Red$, $\Cored$, and $\Wat$ to this judgment as inference
rules using \citeauthor{Licata2017}'s framework. Because the type theory is
derived straightforwardly from this framework, we get some meta-theoretic
results---substitution, structural rules, etc---for free.\footnote{Although we
  must be careful about the proof that our type system corresponds exactly to an
  instance of \citeauthor{Licata2017}'s framework.} \JP{Do we want to give any
  further details of the mode theory here?}

\todo{Key question: what are the contributions of this work?}

Future work will extend this type theory to dependent and identity types.
\todo{Indicate what is hard about this.}
