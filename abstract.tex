\JP{How to use comments: use your initials as a command to make a comment
  terminated by your name, \eg \texttt{\textbackslash JP\{my comments\}}. May
  also use \texttt{fixme}, \texttt{note}, \texttt{todo}, and \texttt{tocite}.
  You can change your keyword, color, etc in the preamble. To remove all
  comments, \eg when submitting, uncomment the \texttt{draftfalse}
  command in this document.}

Internal languages \FW{I do not know, if Type Theories themselves have internal language, 
as I understand the notion ``internal language'', some Type Theories \emph{are} internal languages \emph{of} special categories.
So I changed this sentence... Great comment-function ;-)} 
 that allow mathematicians to reason
\emph{synthetically} about mathematical structures. While Homotopy Type Theory
provides an internal language for $(\infty,1)$-toposes, it is also possible to
consider Type Theories that correspond to $(\infty,1)$-toposes with extra structure
of interest in Algebraic and Differential Geometry. 

In previous work,
\citet{Shulman2015} constructs a type theory for
$(\infty,1)$-toposes with an additional ``cohesive'' structure.
In this setting, derivations in the type theory correspond
to continuous maps that respect the cohesive structure of the space, which
allows for a synthetic proof of, for example, Brower's fixed-point theorem,
which states that all continuous maps over the topological disk have a fixed
point~\citep{Shulman2015}. 
This theorem has no synthetic proof in ordinary homotopy type theory.

To capture cohesion in the type theory, \citep{Shulman2015} and
\citep{Licata2016} use \emph{modal} type theories~\tocite{pfenning and davis?}
to describe the categorical structure of cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes, which is
shown in black in \cref{fig:modalities}. \todo{say more about the type theory,
  difference between the two papers.}

  \todo{use colors to distinguish real-cohesive vs differential-cohesive
    modalities. Also include the quadruple adjoint functors between different

In this work we aim at constructing a type theory similar to Shulman's real-cohesive type theory,
having all the operations of what are called differential cohesive toposes.
\FW{I am quite sure, that Mike invented the term ``real cohesion'' for 
his more specific version of cohesion, where $\shape$ is defined as localization using the Dedekind-reals.
So I removed ``real'' on some instances.}
This additional structure, explored and used in \citet{Schreiber2013} 
to reason about spaces of interest to modern physics, 
 and allows synthetic reasoning about 
higher differential geometry. 
In particular, \citeauthor{Wellen2017}
considers a small fragment of differential cohesive type theory that uses just
the $\Cored$ modality. A full type theory for differential cohesion would cover
not just the three differential modalities, but also the three cohesive
modalities, all shown together in \cref{fig:modalities}.

Following the \citeyear{Licata2016} paper on cohesion, \citet{Licata2017}
developed a general construction for non-dependent modal type theories, which we
instantiate for differential cohesion in this paper. Future work will extend
this type theory to dependent and identity types.
